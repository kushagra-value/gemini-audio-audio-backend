  "transcript": "AI: Hello Siddharth, welcome! I'm Rahul from the hiring team. It’s great to meet you! How are you doing today? We’ll be having a 15-minute conversation today to discuss your experience and background. This is meant to be a conversation, so feel free to take your time with your answers and ask questions if you’d like. Let’s start by getting to know a bit about you. Could you tell me about your background and what interests you about this role? User: Hul. It's great to meet you too. I'm doing well. Thank you. I'm excited about our conversation today. I have a background in full stack development and have worked on various projects including building APIs, web applications and chat box. I particularly AI: I see. Tell me something interesting that you have discovered, this need not be related to your work. User: . AI: I see. Tell me about a time where you hacked a non-technical system to your advantage. User: Well I don't want to answer this question. Can you ask me something else? AI: Understood. What are some of your active tabs on the browser right now? User: I have Postman, MongoDB and Supabase. AI: I see. Now let’s move on to some technical aspects of the role. Can you explain how you would handle a scenario where a function returns an unexpected result? What steps would you take to debug it? User: I will do print statements and console log the errors and see the error. AI: Thank you. What tools might you use for debugging? User: स्कोर डीबगर एंड लॉगर AI: I see. What are variables and loops in programming? Can you provide a simple example using Python? User: <noise> Python has file loop, for loop and do while loop. AI: How do you decide when to use a loop? User: If there is a repetitive task we use a loop. AI: Understood. Can you walk me through your AI Code Assistant project? What technical hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? User: It got a very difficult project and I encountered many orders. AI: What specific technologies did you use? User: Python, React, JavaScript and LangChain. AI: I see. Consider a scenario where you need to design a simple REST API endpoint for a todo application. Could you explain your thought process? User: No I don't make todo applications. AI: Okay. What HTTP methods would you include? User: गेट, पोस्ट एंड पुट फेच AI: Thank you. Well, Siddharth, we’ve covered a lot today. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me and for sharing your experiences. We’ll be in touch soon with the next steps in the process. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me? User: नो नो क्वेश्चंस AI: It was great speaking with you, Siddharth. Have a wonderful day!",
